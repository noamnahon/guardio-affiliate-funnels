        <!-- Article Body -->
        <div class="article-content">
          
          <p class="lead">Last month, I came within seconds of handing over my Amazon login, my credit card information, and potentially my entire savings to criminals. And the scary part? The email looked <em>exactly</em> like every other Amazon email I've ever received.</p>

          <p>I'm sharing this story because I don't want anyone else to go through what I did. If it can happen to me — someone who's been online since the dial-up days — it can happen to anyone.</p>

          <h2>It Started With an Email</h2>

          <p>It was a Tuesday afternoon. I was checking my email when I saw a message from "Amazon" with the subject line: <strong>"Order Confirmation: MacBook Pro - $1,847.99"</strong></p>

          <p>My heart dropped. I hadn't ordered a MacBook. Someone must have gotten into my account.</p>

          <p>The email looked perfect — the Amazon logo, the orange buttons, the formatting. Everything. At the bottom, there was a helpful link: <strong>"Didn't make this purchase? Cancel order here."</strong></p>

          <p>Of course I clicked it. Wouldn't you?</p>

          <h2>The Page That Almost Fooled Me</h2>

          <p>I landed on what looked exactly like Amazon's login page. Same colors, same layout, same "Sign in" button. I was about to type in my password when something made me pause.</p>

          <p>The URL bar.</p>

          <p>Instead of <strong>amazon.com</strong>, it said something like <strong>amazon-secure-verify.com</strong>.</p>

          <p>I closed the tab immediately. My hands were shaking.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>"I was one click away from giving criminals access to my Amazon account, my saved credit cards, and who knows what else."</p>
          </blockquote>

          <h2>The Wake-Up Call</h2>

          <p>That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking: <em>What if I hadn't noticed the URL?</em></p>

          <p>I called my son the next morning. He's in IT, and I told him what happened. His response surprised me.</p>

          <p><strong>"Mom, you got lucky. Those phishing sites are getting so good that even I almost fell for one last year."</strong></p>

          <p>He helped me check if my email had been in any data breaches. Turns out, my email address was exposed in <strong>three different breaches</strong> over the past few years — and I had no idea.</p>

          <p>That explained how they knew my name and that I shop on Amazon. They weren't randomly targeting me. They <em>knew</em> things about me.</p>

          <h2>What I Did Next</h2>

          <p>My son recommended I install something on my browser that would catch these fake sites before I could even see them. He said it works in the background — I wouldn't have to do anything.</p>

          <p>I was skeptical. I've tried antivirus software before and it always slowed down my computer or bombarded me with popups.</p>

          <p>But I trusted him, so I tried it.</p>

          <p>A week later, I got another suspicious email. This time, when I clicked the link (old habits die hard), a warning popped up immediately: <strong>"This site has been identified as a phishing attempt."</strong></p>

          <p>It blocked me from even seeing the fake page.</p>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>That's when I realized:</strong> I don't have to be a computer expert to stay safe online. I just need the right tool watching my back.</p>
          </div>

          <h2>Why I'm Sharing This</h2>

          <p>I'm not a tech person. I'm a retired teacher who likes to shop online, check Facebook, and email my grandkids. I shouldn't have to worry about criminals every time I open my inbox.</p>

          <p>If you're like me — someone who uses the internet but doesn't want to become a cybersecurity expert — I want you to know: <strong>you're not alone, and there is help.</strong></p>

          <p>The tool my son recommended has been running quietly on my browser for a month now. I've completely forgotten it's there — until it blocks something dangerous. And that's exactly how I want it.</p>

          <p>I'm not going to tell you what to do. But if my story sounds familiar, or if you've ever wondered "am I protected?" — it might be worth taking a look.</p>
