            <strong>If you think you're safe online because you have antivirus software, think again.</strong> A new report from the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) reveals that 91% of all cyberattacks now start in the browser—not through traditional malware.
          </p>

          <h2>The New Threat Landscape</h2>
          <p>
            Gone are the days when a simple antivirus program could keep you safe. Today's cybercriminals have evolved, using sophisticated techniques that bypass traditional security measures entirely.
          </p>

          <div class="stat-callout">
            <div class="stat-number">91%</div>
            <div class="stat-text">of cyberattacks now originate in the browser</div>
          </div>

          <p>
            These attacks include:
          </p>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li><strong>Phishing sites</strong> that look identical to legitimate websites</li>
            <li><strong>Malicious browser extensions</strong> that steal your data</li>
            <li><strong>Drive-by downloads</strong> that infect your computer silently</li>
            <li><strong>Session hijacking</strong> that steals your login credentials</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Why Traditional Antivirus Isn't Enough</h2>
          <p>
            Traditional antivirus software scans files on your computer for known malware signatures. But modern browser-based attacks never download files to your system—they operate entirely within your browser, making them invisible to conventional security tools.
          </p>

          <blockquote class="expert-quote">
            <p>"The browser has become the new operating system. It's where we do our banking, shopping, and communication. Yet most people have zero protection at this critical vulnerability point."</p>
            <cite>— Dr. James Chen, Director of Cybersecurity Research at MIT</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <h2>Real Stories from Real Victims</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Mark, 52, from Ohio</strong> lost $12,000 when he clicked a link in what appeared to be an email from his bank. The phishing site was so convincing that even the URL looked legitimate.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Jennifer, 34, from California</strong> had her identity stolen after a malicious browser extension captured her passwords. She spent months recovering her credit score.
          </p>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h3>⚠️ Warning Signs You May Already Be Compromised</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Unexpected pop-ups or redirects</li>
              <li>Browser running slower than usual</li>
              <li>Unknown extensions in your browser</li>

          <h2>The Solution: Browser-Level Protection</h2>
          <p>
            Security experts now recommend adding a dedicated browser security layer to your protection strategy. Unlike traditional antivirus, browser security tools work in real-time to:
          </p>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li>Block phishing sites before you enter any information</li>
            <li>Detect malicious downloads instantly</li>
            <li>Alert you when your data appears in breaches</li>
            <li>Identify and remove harmful browser extensions</li>
          </ul>
