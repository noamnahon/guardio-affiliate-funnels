## Executive Summary

This document outlines four distinct affiliate landing page funnels designed for Guardio's partner program. Each funnel targets a specific traffic source and user intent level, utilizing proven psychological principles to maximize conversions.

**Key Insight:** Guardio's core audience (53% female, ages 55-64) values simplicity and peace of mind over technical features. These funnels are designed with that demographic in mind while remaining effective across all age groups.

**Affiliate Usage:** These funnels can be white-labeled or provided as landing page templates for affiliates, reducing their barrier to entry and ensuring brand-consistent messaging. Affiliates can customize CTAs and tracking while maintaining Guardio's conversion-optimized structure.

| Funnel | Traffic Type | User Intent | Primary Psychology |
|--------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Top 10 Comparison | SEO / Paid Search | High | Authority + Social Proof |
| Quiz Funnel | Social / Native Ads | Medium | Personalization + Commitment |
| VS Comparison | SEO / Retargeting | High | Simplification + Validation |
| Pre-lander | Pop / Push Ads | None | Storytelling + Relatability |

### Expected Performance Metrics

## Funnel 1: Top 10 Comparison (Listicle)

### Live Demo
**[View Top 10 Comparison Page](https://noamnahon.github.io/guardio-affiliate-funnels/pages/top-10-comparison/)**

### Overview
A comprehensive "Best Browser Security of 2025" listicle that positions Guardio as the #1 choice through objective-seeming comparison with 9 competitors.

### Target Audience
Users in the **consideration/decision phase** who are actively comparing products before purchase. They want validation that they're making the right choice.

### Psychological Principles Used

## Funnel 2: Quiz Funnel (Security Assessment)

### Live Demo

### Best Traffic Sources
- **Facebook/Instagram Ads** — "Take the free security quiz" hooks

- **Email Marketing** — Re-engagement campaigns for security-conscious lists
- **YouTube Pre-roll** — "Find out if you're at risk in 60 seconds"

### Target Audience
Users with **medium intent** — they're not actively shopping but are security-curious. Often triggered by hearing about a friend's scam experience or news about data breaches.

### Psychological Principles Used

#### 1. Commitment & Consistency (Cialdini)
- Users invest time answering 7 questions
- Each answer deepens psychological commitment
- By the results page, they've "earned" the recommendation
- Sunk cost makes them more likely to act on advice

#### 2. Personalization Effect
- Browser auto-detection ("You're using Chrome on Windows")
- Questions feel tailored to their specific situation
- Results reference their actual answers
- "Based on your responses..." framing

#### 3. Curiosity Gap
- "Your Security Score: ?/100" creates anticipation
- Progress bar builds tension
- Loading screen with "Analyzing your responses..." heightens reveal

### Conversion Elements
- Auto-advancing questions (no friction)
- Dramatic results reveal with risk visualization
- CTA visible immediately on results page (above fold)
- Specific vulnerabilities listed based on answers
- Family plan value highlighted ($4.67/user messaging)

## Funnel 3: VS Comparison (Head-to-Head)

### Live Demo
**[View VS Comparison Page](https://noamnahon.github.io/guardio-affiliate-funnels/pages/vs-comparison/)**

### Overview
A dynamic "Guardio vs [Competitor]" comparison page with a selector allowing users to compare Guardio against Norton, McAfee, Malwarebytes, or Bitdefender.

### Best Traffic Sources
- **Organic SEO** — "Guardio vs Norton", "Guardio vs McAfee" searches
- **Competitor Retargeting** — Users who visited Norton/McAfee but didn't convert
- **Brand Defense** — Capture users searching competitor names
- **Paid Search** — Competitor keyword bidding

### Target Audience
Users in **late-stage decision making** who have narrowed choices to 2-3 options. They want a clear winner to end their research.

### Psychological Principles Used

#### 1. Choice Simplification
- Complex decision reduced to clear side-by-side comparison
- Category-by-category breakdown (Protection, Speed, Value, etc.)
- Visual "Winner" badges eliminate ambiguity
- "Which is right for you?" section provides clear recommendations

#### 2. Winner Effect
- Guardio wins most categories against each competitor
- Running score creates momentum ("Guardio: 5, Norton: 2")
- Visual progress reinforces Guardio's dominance

#### 3. Strategic Value Framing
- Price comparison focuses on long-term value, not first-year discounts
- "Price Stability" category highlights competitor renewal increases
- Family plan value emphasized over individual pricing
- "Your price stays the same" vs competitor price jumps

### Conversion Elements

## Funnel 4: Pre-lander (Personal Story)

### Live Demo
**[View Pre-lander Page](https://noamnahon.github.io/guardio-affiliate-funnels/pages/pre-lander/)**

### Overview
A personal story article titled "How I Almost Lost $8,000 to a Scam That Looked Completely Real" — designed to warm up cold traffic before sending them to Guardio's homepage.

### Best Traffic Sources
- **Pop/Popunder Ads** — Interruption-based traffic with zero intent
- **Push Notifications** — Alert-style ads on mobile/desktop
- **Display Network** — Banner ads on content sites
- **Native Ads** — Sponsored content placements

### Target Audience
Users with **no existing intent** — they weren't looking for security software. The pre-lander's job is to CREATE intent through emotional engagement before directing to the offer.

### Psychological Principles Used

#### 1. Narrative Transportation
- Story format bypasses ad skepticism
- Reader becomes emotionally invested in Linda's experience
- First-person perspective creates intimacy
- Problem → Near-miss → Discovery → Solution arc

#### 2. Relatability & Identification
- Linda M., 58, retired teacher — matches core demographic
- "I've been online for 20 years. I thought I knew all the tricks."
- Specific, believable details (Amazon email, MacBook order)
- "If it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone"

#### 3. Soft Sell / Discovery Framing
- Product never named in the story
- Reader "discovers" the solution alongside Linda
- CTA: "See What Helped Me →" not "Buy Now"
- Links to Guardio homepage, not direct registration

### Conversion Elements
- Clean, article-like design (looks editorial, not ad)
- Large, readable text for 55+ audience
- Single, soft CTA at the end
- "Free to try • Takes 2 minutes to set up"
- Author bio adds authenticity

### Critical Note
**Never send cold traffic directly to an offer page.** Pre-landers can double conversion rates by warming users before the main pitch. This page creates the intent that other funnels assume already exists.
